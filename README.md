### About LSAMP
The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program, funded by the National Science Foundation, is designed to increase the number of professionals from minority groups that are traditionally underrepresented in non-medical STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math). The program, which now includes over 50 alliances, provides support services at many levels to help interested students be successful in STEM majors and is considered one of the most successful programs of its kind.

Since its inception in 2009, the mission of the Garden State LSAMP has been to increase the interest, retention, graduation and success of students from racial and ethnic groups that are historically underrepresented in STEM fields. Phase II of the program (2014-2019) focused on <i>1) assisting community college students to successfully transfer to four-year programs, 2) preparing and assisting students to matriculate into graduate programs, and 3) increasing student opportunities for international experiences</i>. Phase III (2019-2024) will continue these goals as well as <i>1) increase STEM degrees awarded to underrepresented minority students by 60%, 2) increase the number of LSAMP scholars continuing to graduate school by 25%, and 3) increase international experiences by 25%</i>.
